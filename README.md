# Moneyhub Tech Test - Property Details

This is a prototype of a new feature in Moneyhub
Customers will now be able to receive automatic value updates on their properties
and we would like to enhance the experience by summarizing their changes

Please read this whole document before starting

This prototype is built using NextJS and makes use of styled components

## Requirements

We would like you to:

----

**Required**: Add a "Valuation changes" section to the page. `design-mock-up.png` has been provided as a design reference for the page and `detail-design-mock-up.png` shows the specific feature to be added, including how it is styled responsively. Make use of existing fonts and styles to match the look and feel of the existing app rather than trying to match the mock up exactly.

 ```
  sincePurchase = `recentValuation - originalPurchasePrice`
  sincePurchasePercentage = `sincePurchase / originalPurchasePrice * 100`
  annualAppreciation =`sincePurchasePercentage / number of years since purchase`
  colours used for the positive change in the image are #c2f7e1 and #006b57
 ```

Consider what other data this component could take and how that might affect your theming and solution

Consider opportunities to reduce repetition in the code and increase legibility
- This could be creating new components, simplifying existing ones, extracting helper function to simplify code or styling
- Show us what you can do and implement a few of these if you have time

We also ask that you update the readme with answers to the following questions 

1. Given more time, what other changes you would have liked to make?
2. What UX or design improvements or alterations might you suggest? These can be to existing components or completely new ideas.

----

**Optional**: If you have time, show us some more by fetching the data from the api
  - Currently the property data is hardcoded in the component, but it is also avaible via a Next.js api route
  - Details of a property are located in the API at `/api/account`, use this endpoint to populate the app with data
  - Use whichever method or library you are comfortable with to fetch the data

----

Try to:

- Ensure markup is semantic and accessible
- Make use of a centralised theme
- Make effective use of Git

We prefer:

- Functional React components
- `styled-components` for styling
- `prop-types` for typechecking

----

**IMPORTANT**

Most of your work should take place inside the `components/` and `modules/` directory. There are some example components and styles available and the theme is defined in `theme/`. This task has been mocked up in Next.js to provide a full working environment and as such shouldn't be taken as a _complete_ application. We are interested in assessing your React frontend skills and are not testing your knowledge of Next.js, you should not need to make any changes in the `pages/` directory.

### Notes

We recommend working through the list of requirements above but don't expect you to finish all of them. We're more interested in seeing how you approach the problem than seeing a perfect example, please only spend a few hours working on it. 

On completion, email a link to your repository to your contact at Moneyhub, and ensure it is publicly accessible.

## Getting Started

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333) with your browser to see the result.

You can start by looking at `modules/property-details/index`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

## Candidate Notes

to run tests run the command "npm test"

### Libraries/Testing
Add further tests

Add ESLint/Prettier for code auto format to local code styles
Add typescript for help with autocomplete/type checking

### With extra time
There are a number of things I would like to add/refactor.
* Get intl month names rather than just english names
* Investigate date comparison libraries for existing helper functions (date-fns)
* Investigate changing between currencies
* I would like to break down the larger component and try to reduce the complexity of the main component
* I would achieve this by removing logic from within the component. I appreciate I have added logic in to the components too... with 
* As I had limited time I did not get a chance to get to the refactor phase.
* I would add in the flex box using a media query (with the provided break points) to make the valuation component responsive.
* I would like to work out why the line-height in the Valuation is different
* Add Husky or other pre/post commit hook to automatically run tests and linting checks before commits

* Add API requests directly in the component with getServerSideProps() (nextjs)
* Add a nicer loading screen while waiting for API requests
* Investigate and upgrade all the packages with a current potential exploitable vulnerability 

### UX UI Changes.
I can see very little of the app to consider UI/UX changes without seeing the 
rest of the app and how it would impact other parts of the product and 
hence overall desgin and feel.
A currency and language conversion function would be good but probably you already have that.

I have left in the commits from all stages of my work but if this was an actual final commit I would sqaush them down to fewer commits to better represent the important steps.

An extra item to do is probably to specify in the package.json the node version to use with 
to make sure all colleagues are using the most similar environments possible (if not premade docker containers)
For example
  "engines" : { 
    "npm" : ">=8.0.0 <9.0.0",
    "node" : ">=16.0.0 <17.0.0"
  }


### Post Submission Fixes
I missed the AccountList Wrappers.
This caused to misunderstand why I was getting a difference
This has now been fixed.
Added in the responsivitiy as per the spec.
Put the % sign in the bracket for the percentage change

The branch that I will PR will be called fix/ks-update-pr
